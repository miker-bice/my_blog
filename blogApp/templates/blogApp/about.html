    <p>
      This is the blog site I made using Python and Django. <br />
      You might not see much here but I built this website with the following
      technologies:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <ul class="my-4">
        <p><strong>Front-End</strong></p>
        <li>HTML | CSS | JavaScript | Tailwind CSS</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="my-4">
        <p><strong>Back-end</strong></p>
        <li>Python | Django | SQLite</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The secret ingredient in making this website is ðŸ’œ, a lot of ðŸ’œ. If you
      love what you are doing it becomes like your very own pet that you'll try
      to nurture.
